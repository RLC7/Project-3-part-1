# Project-3-part-1
#For this project we are supposed to parse and analyze a log file from a website,
#trasnfer this into a file and read the lines to answer questions.
#We used Python 3 and we used Wing IDE 101 to write the code and run it.
#We managed to get the website saved into a file and read it. 
#We also managed to get the program to show how many requests was made, how many requests each day, and how many per month.
#However, we did not manage to do the rest of the project, but we did do our best.
